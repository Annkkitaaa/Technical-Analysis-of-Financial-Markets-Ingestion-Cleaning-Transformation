# Technical-Analysis-of-Financial-Markets-Ingestion-Cleaning-Transformation

steps i will have to go through
To start with this assignment, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand Requirements**: Read and understand the provided scenario and tasks thoroughly. This will help you grasp the objectives and scope of the assignment.

2. **Choose a Dataset**: Since the assignment mentions using OHLC data feeds, you can use financial data from sources like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or any other similar platform. For simplicity, you can start with the `yfinance` library to fetch OHLC data for multiple stocks. Choose 5-10 equities as a sample dataset.

3. **Setup Environment**: Set up your Python environment with necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and any other libraries mentioned in the tasks.

4. **Data Ingestion**: Write a Python script to ingest OHLC data from the chosen data source (e.g., Yahoo Finance). You can use the `yfinance` library to fetch the data. Ensure that your script can handle different formats like CSV or JSON.

5. **Data Cleaning**: Develop functions to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in timestamps or date formats. Use pandas and numpy functionalities for data manipulation and cleaning.

6. **Data Transformation**: Write functions to calculate technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), apply feature engineering techniques, and resample the data as per the desired frequencies.

7. **Data Validation**: Implement unit tests using libraries like pytest to validate the functionality of your pipeline and ensure data integrity. Monitor the pipeline for errors and data quality issues.

8. **Data Storage**: Use a simple database like SQLite or MySQL to store the processed data. Partition the data by relevant categories for efficient querying. You can use pandas' built-in functionalities to export data to databases.

9. **Bonus Tasks**: If time permits, implement bonus tasks such as data compression techniques, integration with visualization tools, and developing data quality checks and alerts.

10. **Documentation and Testing**: Document your code thoroughly, including comments and docstrings. Test your pipeline with sample data to ensure it functions as expected.

11. **Example Output**: Provide example output showcasing cleaned and transformed data for a specific period as requested in the deliverables.

Remember to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable steps and tackle them one at a time. You can start with data ingestion and progressively move towards data storage and bonus tasks. Don't forget to refer to documentation and online resources as needed.

Here's a simple example to get you started with fetching data using `yfinance`:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define a list of stock symbols
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Fetch OHLC data for the specified stocks
data = yf.download(stocks, start='2023-01-01', end='2024-01-01')

this one if for assignment for investoo


# Display the first few rows of the data
print(data.head())
```

This script will fetch OHLC data for the specified stocks from Yahoo Finance for the year 2023. You can expand upon this to develop your data pipeline.
